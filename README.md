# Simply-Study
iOS Application for creating, organizing, and studying flash cards.

A free iOS application to create and study flash cards developed using Apple's new framework, SwiftUI. While still in it's early stages, some issues were encountered, but mostly overcome by interfacing with UIKit or 'hacking' past it by doing some..odd coding. Feel free too check out the code to see what is possible with the framework.
